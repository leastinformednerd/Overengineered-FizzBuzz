# Overengineered FizzBuzz
Most FizzBuzz solutions require a developer to manually implement them from a specification.
No longer is this required

This program takes a specification and automatically generates a program in the C programming
language that takes a integer on stdin and produces the output according to normal fizzbuzz rules
up to that number (i.e the specification in example.fb produces identical output to normal fizzbuzz)

At some point I will have it produce a .s but I wanted the instant gratification of it functioning
so it currently emits C.
